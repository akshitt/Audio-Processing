# Audio-Processing
I Will be reading up on audio processing for my internship at Duke University and keeping relevant stuff here. Link to GDrive - [Duke](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NIgnEmLMugQUwR_ilkgHIskqYfV8dx9c?usp=sharing)   
[Progress Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AbSwuFQhJF9W0XB-EotXYFiuZ9I35bLrpWuaBlJk2wo/edit?usp=sharing)
## Week-1
- Revisited the paper on [Mechano-acoustic sensing](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347308988_Long-term_continuous_and_multimodal_monitoring_of_respiratory_digital_biomarkers_via_wireless_epidermal_mechano-acoustic_sensing_in_clinical_and_home_settings_for_COVID-19_patients) of physiological processes
- Went through MFCC [tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/ilyamich/mfcc-implementation-and-tutorial), Here's the [summary](./MFCC_tutorial.ipynb) for reference.
- Completed 4 weeks of a [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing) on Audio Signal Processing. 
- Read a publication on [Audio Super-Resolution](https://www.amazon.science/publications/audio-super-resolution-for-speech-recognition)
- Went through the code provided by Moses in this [repository](https://github.com/mosesfuego/YES_NO-ALL)

## Week-2
- Went through 4 papers describing different methods of BWE -
  - [A deep neural network approach to speech bandwidth expansion. 2015](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7178801)
  - [ Audio super-resolution using neural net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00853.pdf)
  - [Speech Bandwidth Extension Using Generative Adversarial Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8462588)
  - [ Audio Super-Resolution for Speech Recognition](https://www.amazon.science/publications/audio-super-resolution-for-speech-recognition)
  - I compiled them as a presentation - [Summary](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12bt9nd7ysvaw8uuf6zvIDTP-xHePY6l3UQP-r1t6V5E/edit?usp=sharing)

## Week-3
- Completed remaining 6 weeks of the [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing) on Audio Signal Processing. [Here](./Coursera-ASP/README.md) are the notes and implementation.
