# Audio-Processing
Will be reading up on audio processing and keeping relevant stuff here. Link to GDrive - [Duke](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NIgnEmLMugQUwR_ilkgHIskqYfV8dx9c?usp=sharing)

## Week-1
- Revisited the paper on [Mechano-acoustic sensing](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347308988_Long-term_continuous_and_multimodal_monitoring_of_respiratory_digital_biomarkers_via_wireless_epidermal_mechano-acoustic_sensing_in_clinical_and_home_settings_for_COVID-19_patients) of physiological processes
- Went through MFCC [tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/ilyamich/mfcc-implementation-and-tutorial), Here's the [summary](./MFCC_tutorial.ipynb) for reference.
- Currently doing a [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing) on Audio Signal Processing. [Here](./Coursera-ASP/README.md) are the notes and implementation.
- Read a publication on [Audio Super-Resolution](https://www.amazon.science/publications/audio-super-resolution-for-speech-recognition)
- Went through the code provided by Moses in this [repository](https://github.com/mosesfuego/YES_NO-ALL)
